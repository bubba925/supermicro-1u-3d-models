I forked this repo to upload the jscad files as STL for easier use. JSCAD had revisions since 2020 making the code a little bit more difficult to convert to STL than anticipated. I did not design any of the models.

This includes a 40mm fan array for the 1u supermicro chassis, a 40mm adapter for the back of a PSU, 2.5" SSD trays and an air shroud. Personally I am using them in re-purposed barracuda appliance chassis.
